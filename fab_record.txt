To record video sequences, press the RECORD button
next to the status line.  Every snapshot recorded by the
video camera will be stored as a file whose name
includes the timestamp formatted as the number of seconds 
in the present day, with microsecond resolution.

The directory into which files are recorded can be
specified in the FILE menu.

The file format for recorded images is a property of the
recorder that can be chosen from the PROPERTIES menu.

The recorder spawns multiple processes to improve performance
and avoid dropped frames.  If too few of process threads are
allocated, the recorder may drop frames.  Increasing the number
of threads increases memory usage, and can overload the computer's
storage system.  The number of threads is a property of the
recorder that can be chosen from the PROPERTIES menu.
